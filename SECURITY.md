# Security Policy

For reporting security vulnerabilities, please do not use GitHub issues in this repository which are public. Disclosing a vulnerability publicly might lead to situation when the vulnerability is widely known but no fix is yet available, thus harming other users. Instead, please disclose the vulnerability privately according guideline in [Spotflow's company security policy](https://github.com/spotflow-io/security).

Ultimately, all vulnerability will be made public and the reporter will be properly credited for the discovery but not before a fix is available.
